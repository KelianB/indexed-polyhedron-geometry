## About

This is a demonstration of the implementation of an indexed polyhedron geometry in THREE.js. Among other things, indexed geometries benefit from smooth shading (approximating the normal at a vertex by averaging the normals of its connected faces) and, in highly-connected meshes, a lower memory footprint.
